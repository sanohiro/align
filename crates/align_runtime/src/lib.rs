//! M1 wires the first real entry point: the builtin `print` lowers to a call to
//! [`align_rt_print_i64`]. Formatting lives here (not in codegen) so it can later be
//! swapped for a SIMD itoa without touching the compiler (`open-questions.md` Future).

/// Builtin `print` for integers: write the decimal value + newline to stdout.

/// M1 widens every integer argument to `i64` in codegen and routes it here. `bool`,
